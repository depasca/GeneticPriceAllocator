# GeneticPriceAllocator

A C++ implementation of a genetic algorithm for solving fair price allocation problems. This project is an experiment: it uses evolutionary computation techniques to find near-optimal solutions for distributing prices across multiple entities while maintaining fairness constraints. However it does not converge to an optimal solution, because while genetic algorithms work well in continuous space, the solution space of this problem is discrete. Nonetheless it is an interesting experiment that shows how genetic algorithms work.

🎯 Overview
GeneticPriceAllocator tackles the complex problem of price allocation using genetic algorithms - a metaheuristic optimization approach inspired by natural selection. The algorithm evolves a population of candidate solutions over successive generations, using operations like selection, crossover, and mutation to converge towards optimal price distributions.
